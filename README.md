# Team JIRA Github Activity Chatbot

## Description

This is a command-line AI chatbot that integrates with JIRA and GitHub APIs to answer questions about team member activities. It fetches recent issues, pull requests, and commits for a given user, and generates human-readable summaries using either the OpenAI API or template-based responses.

## Features

- Parse natural language queries to extract team member names
- Fetch assigned JIRA issues and recent updates
- Fetch recent GitHub pull requests and commits
- AI-powered or template-based response generation
- Handles error cases (user not found, no recent activity)
- Simple CLI interface

## Usage Instructions

2. **Interact via CLI**

   - Type a question about a team member, e.g.:
     ```
     What is John working on these days?
     Show me recent activity for Sarah
     What has Mike been working on this week?
     ```
   - Type `exit` to quit.

3. **Response Types**
   - If OpenAI API key is set, responses use AI summaries.
   - Otherwise, template-based responses are used.
